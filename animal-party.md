Animal Party!
<<<<<<< HEAD

Once upon a time in Motueka, some humans threw a party for animals. First to arrive was Merrin's cat, Jack, who she brought from Wellington. He found someone to cuddle him.

Joy the Unicorn popped in for a visit. She started off the day full of enthusiasm and feeling like she could take on the world. By 3pm she wasn't quite floating on air like before....

She then wondered if her attempt at inserting an image worked. Joy the Unicorn is getting a headache now :-)
