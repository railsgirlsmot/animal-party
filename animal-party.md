Animal Party!

Once upon a time in Motueka, some humans threw a party for animals. First to arrive was Merrin's cat, Jack, who she brought from Wellington. He found someone to cuddle him.

Next to arrive was Chico, the cutest, cuddliest canine ever - Tania's smoochey shih tzu "moko-puppy" (Mokopuna is the Maori term for grandchild).
